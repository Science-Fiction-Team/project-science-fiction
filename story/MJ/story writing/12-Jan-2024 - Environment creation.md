This is the Night city at least that’s what we land dwellers call it and the top of the pyramid guys call this the land of scums. They don’t live with us heck they don’t even put their feet on the ground. Those guys live far above the clouds and someday I’ll be one of their neighbors but little did I knew that I was gonna regret my decision. Back to the night city now for the time being this is me m living on the 8th floor of this 10 floor multi story and swear to god I’ve never a ray of sunlight even while living on this floor.  This city is filled with murderers, burglars, rapists and what not. You ask why? its simple because of poverty, lack of food, resources. Only one rule is followed here VOILENCE,  only the strongest group survives here and for those who are not strong gets trampled by others. I belong to one of these top packs and fortunately my pal is the pack leader, kind to us,  ruthless to others.
