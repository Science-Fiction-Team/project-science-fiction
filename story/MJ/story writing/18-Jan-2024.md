# **Day to day life :**

I and P live together along with P’s mom. We wake up and have amazing breakfast from aunt. Before leaving for our daily errands she always nags us to leave this kind of life and get a job like her in a bar or something but me and P already decided how we’re gonna live our life after he lost his father and I lost Mr. Father(name for later case ) as well, he was the closest to me as a father figure. Aunt is the one thing that gave us a peaceful presence in this shit show of a city and we won’t allow anybody to take her away from us.

 Oh well leaving our home we go straight to x  ( gathering location for the gang)  discuss what we’re gonna do today either we enjoy to the fullest or we go hunting for some carbon and make money from selling it. I know I know we can use carbon for our own augmentation but after researching on this topic I concluded we needed a good techie ( might change the name ) to at least have less consequences as much as possible, making sure that we don’t get rusty or go crazy using carbon. Our old techie was one hell of a guy. Credits to him we only suffered from minor glitches from time to time but unfortunately he left the city ( or died , we’ll think more about it ) and we can’t just start augmenting with anybody. Don’t get me wrong but having no carbon is way better than having a malfunctioning one.
