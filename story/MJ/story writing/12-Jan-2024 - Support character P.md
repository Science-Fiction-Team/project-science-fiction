# Jan 13, 2024, support Character P

P (for m’s best pal). P lost his father due to gang wars and his mother took care of him. M lost his parents early on so P’s mom took care of him. 

P honed his fighting skills by being around his father’s friends. He made his group and being a muscle guy he made his name through brute force. 

M was a smart ass and used his brain to assist P in his endeavors. M focused more on being street smarts and  focused on tactics. He made sure that P always survived gang wars and made his escape routes thorough. P’s strength and M’s brain is what made them the top group in the LC.
