# 1. Discussion results 6th Jan 2024

- Starting : Create the Environment for our world + start the triller stuff to make it engaging from the get go.
- Middle : The hardest Part I guess, didn’t emphasis much on this one because we didn’t start writing the story yet but it’ll include the back story of our protagonists as well, some slight history on them or might reveal everything regarding them. ( much more discussion needed here )
- Finale : 1. One Protagonist reaches the end of our world and vaporises like the predecessors but as it turns out he’s given a choice to either return back to reality or go back to the experimental world.
           2. Protagonist two and three aka  Rich and poor guy. In finale it is revealed that  both these    guys have the same soul spilt into two parts or consciousness split into two parts
