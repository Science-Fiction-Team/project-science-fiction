# The Upper City(UC) arc

Relationship between UC and LC protagonists 

- Assume LC protagonist = L
- Assume UC protagonist = U
1. U who is a quantum-twin of L somehow becomes aware of the presence of his twin.(L however is completely unaware of this fact)
2. He creates certain situations which leads to L struggling his way to the top and finally reaching UC.
3. L’s life is now completely messed up due to U (he lost many friends and family in the way) so there can be a brief moment where they are in a minor conflict with eachother
4. U’s life goal is to merge with L. L hesitates at first but eventually they do combine.

Motivation to reach UC (work in progress…will update soon)
