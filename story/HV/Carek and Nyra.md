The rookie, finally out of the mess, glances straight towards the distant skyscrapers bathed in neon purple and green. He then looks back at the apartment building one last time with relief and finally stares at the obnoxious AVRA etching on the Nexus Core. He immediately deactivates and removes his navigation headgear, tossing it away near the apartment entrance in an attempt to escape, now that his team can't reach him by pinging the common communication channel.

After switching to his private channel as he moves across the crowded market streets below tall glowing advertisements, he is suddenly bombarded with several text messages from his girlfriend, Nyra. These messages mostly suggest he's running late and that the rendezvous point can now potentially be compromised.

After almost twenty minutes of clumsily traversing through the densely populated market district, he finally reaches the point Nyra mentioned in the text messages.

The bronze statue of Grand Arbiter Moillur stood tall as the rookie slowly walks back and forth below it, looking for Nyra. After waiting there for a few more minutes, the rookie attempts to jump into his private channel again, and then he is immediately grabbed from behind with an overpowering force.

"Which super cybernetic agent did you let follow you this time, Carek?" To which he tries to respond with a muffled voice through Nyra's hand covering his mouth, "Give me a brea...," Nyra cuts him off immediately, "You're well aware every extra second we waste makes the Doc less likely to cooperate." She lets him go, the rookie catching his breath, exhausted, says, "Change of plans, the ShockMixer is the least of our priorities now. I'll need a Thermal Vision implant instead." Nyra, with visible hints of irritation, whispers, "Carek, we talked about this! You can't just change plans out of nowhere like this, and why do you need Thermal Vision anyway? What happened to that headgear of yours? Oh wait... don't tell me...".

The rookie hands her the Nexus core and says with great disappointment, "Things obviously didn't go as planned. I mean, what exactly were you expecting? But we finally have the core now...". Nyra interrupts him again with growing impatience, "So, we are finally on the run from these NuMavs now?" The rookie responds confidently, "Those NuMavs and those husks I can handle. We have a bigger problem than that." Nyra, finally in a calm and lowered voice, says, "What do you mean, bigger problem?".

The rookie sighs with a tired expression and holds Nyra's hand that has the Nexus core, running his finger slowly across the eye-catching logo. Nyra immediately switches back to her usual annoyed expression and shouts, "So it's AVRA hunting us now??!" Carek immediately shuts her down, "Lower your voice, damnit! So much for blending in the crowd!"

The neon glow of the city flickered as Carek and Nyra stood near the bronze statue, their faces illuminated by the ambient light. The Nexus Core, now in Nyra's possession, was a weighty reminder of the challenges they faced. Carek glanced at the city's holographic skyline, realizing their names now adorned the wanted lists displayed by the towering advertisements.

Concern etched Nyra's face as she initiated a secure communication channel with their contact, the reserved and intelligent doctor known in the district as Dr. Seraph. As the holographic interface materialized, a shadowy figure appeared, her features obscured. Dr. Seraph's voice, calm and measured, filled the air.

"I assume you have a good reason for reaching out, Nyra," the doctor spoke, her words carrying a sceptical yet authoritative tone.

"We've got the Nexus Core, Doc," Nyra replied, her voice holding a mix of urgency and caution. "Carek needs a Thermal Vision implant, and we need your help."

Doc Seraph's holographic image remained stoic. "Not here, Nyra. Meet me at my clinic."

The holographic interface dissipated, leaving Nyra and Carek with a sense of both reassurance and uncertainty. Nyra turned to Carek, "We'll head to Doc's clinic. She's our best shot at getting the thermal implant."

As they walked through the crowded market streets towards Dr. Seraph's clinic, Carek recalled a conversation he had overheard during his time at AVRA. Dr. Tremor and Dr. Seraph, once colleagues at AVRA, had shared a history marked by ethical disagreements. It was rumored that Dr. Seraph's termination from AVRA was a consequence of raising concerns about the Nexus Core's potential dangers and unethical practices.

Entering the clinic, the couple found themselves surrounded by the hum of cybernetic equipment. Dr. Seraph, in her reserved demeanor, examined the Nexus Core with a careful eye. "This is a risky venture, but we don't have much choice," she remarked.

Nyra handed over the Nexus Core, and Seraph began her work, preparing for Carek's thermal vision implant. The procedure was meticulous, with the doctor's hands moving with precision. As the implant integration progressed, Carek and Nyra shared a moment of quiet reflection.

After the successful implantation, Carek tested his newfound ability to see thermal signatures. A sense of gratitude and relief washed over him as he acknowledged Dr. Seraph's expertise. The doctor, however, remained focused on the larger picture.

"Now that the Nexus Core is with us, there are certain risks involved. We have angered the wrong people, a lot of wrong and powerful people. It's only a matter of time they'll start looking for us. So, I'll just skip to the details without wasting another second. The Nexus Core can be used to control all the AIs that have gone rogue. I can get a few things started but there are aome gaps that need filling. For that, I'll need Dr. Tremor's lab notes to connect some dots. The only thing preventing me from getting my hands on those is the fact that they are placed in a highly secure AVRA facility. And that's where you two come in," Dr. Seraph explained, her detached demeanor concealing a sense of urgency.

Before the couple attempted to conclude their thoughts, Doc Seraph emphasized that the "lab notes" they were seeking were not merely a piece of paper that could be grabbed from a desk. Instead, it was a documentation of the Core itself, stored in an encrypted data chip placed inside a high-security vault.

Nyra, proactive as ever, activated her contacts in the underground network. A plan for a daring heist to retrieve crucial information was set into motion. The couple found themselves drawn deeper into the world of mysteries they had become a part of.

As the days unfolded, the situation worsened. The holographic advertisements now displayed not only Carek and Nyra's names but also depicted them as wanted criminals. The city's surveillance systems intensified their efforts to locate the fugitive couple.

Days turned into nights, and the cityscape morphed into a relentless maze of shifting shadows. The couple, now constantly on the move, sought refuge in the hidden alleys and underground passages of the city. With the Nexus Core now in Seraph's possession and the implanted thermal vision aiding their stealth, they relied on each other's instincts to evade the relentless pursuit.

Nyra, with her contacts, orchestrated a meeting with an informant who claimed to have information on the location of the high-security vault housing the coveted lab notes. The meeting point was a dimly lit bar tucked away in the outskirts of the city, frequented by those with questionable allegiances.

As Carek and Nyra entered the establishment, the low hum of conversations ceased, and curious eyes followed their every move. The couple maintained a facade of nonchalance, aware that in the world they now navigated, trust was a rare commodity.

The informant, a shady figure named Ivex, approached them cautiously. "I hear you're after something big, something that could shake the foundations of AVRA," he whispered, eyes darting nervously.

Nyra nodded, "We need the location of the high-security vault and any additional intel that can help us get those lab notes."

Ivex leaned in, his voice barely audible over the ambient noise of the bar. "Getting into that vault won't be easy. It's guarded by state-of-the-art security systems, and rumors say there's an AI sentinel overseeing the premises."

Carek, his thermal vision scanning the surroundings, detected subtle shifts in the thermal signatures around them. "We're aware of the risks. What do you have for us?"

Ivex slid a holographic chip across the table. "This contains the schematics of the vault's security layout. You'll need to disable the external sensors, avoid the AI sentinel, and crack the access codes to reach the vault."

Nyra pocketed the chip, a glint of determination in her eyes. "Thanks, Ivex. This better be worth it."

As the couple left the bar, the city's holographic advertisements displayed their names more prominently, branding them as cyber criminals. The stakes had risen, and the city's authorities intensified their efforts to capture the fugitives.

Back at their makeshift hideout, Carek and Nyra studied the schematics provided by Shade. Seraph, still reserved but visibly invested in the outcome, joined the discussion. "This won't be a straightforward operation. The security measures are formidable, and the AI sentinel poses a significant threat. We need to approach this with caution," she warned.

With a plan in motion, Nyra activated her contacts for the heist. A team of skilled individuals, each with their own set of cybernetic enhancements, assembled in the shadows. The holographic chip served as their guide, displaying the intricate details of the security layout.

As the night fell and the city plunged into darkness, the team set out on their perilous mission. The neon-lit streets became a silent battleground, and the air buzzed with tension. Carek, Nyra, and their team moved through the shadows, inching closer to the heart of AVRA's secure facility.

Carek, oblivious to Nyra's detour, led the team towards AVRA's secure facility. The holographic chip guided their every step, revealing the intricate dance required to circumvent the defenses.As they approached the facility's outskirts, Carek's private channel buzzed with an unknown caller. Dread settled in as the robotic voice threatened, "We know who you are. We know where you live. You have something of ours. You would be wise to return it or there will be consequences". Nyra, quick-witted, signaled him to engage further, extracting information. Carek asked the caller to identify itself. The synthetic voice revealed itself, promising relentless pursuit until their objective was completed. "We are The Entity", the voice on the other end concluded. The call ended rather abruptly, leaving Carek shaken. 

Nyra, back at the clinic, realized the caller's threat and rushed to check on Dr. Seraph as awell as the Nexus core in her possession. The clinic bore signs of a skirmish, bloodstains marking the aftermath. The distressing sight sent several ripples of paranoia through Nyra. She finally found Seraph, seemingly unfazed, washing blood off her clothes with the corpse of an AVRA agent beside her.

Before Nyra could utter a word, Seraph interjected, "You should have focused on the mission, made a big mistake coming back here."

Nyra, trying to explain, stammered, "I just..."

Seraph dismissed her concerns, asserting, "I know why you're here. Can't you see I'm fine? I can take care of myself."

As Nyra pressed about the threat, Seraph calmly revealed, "Of course, it will try to stop you now that the Sentinel protocol is active."

"S-Sentinel? You mean the security AI protecting the vault? It said its name was 'The Entity,'" Nyra inquired.

"'The Entity' is the Sentinel AI. They're one and same," Seraph clarified.

Panicking, Nyra insisted, "We need to move quickly. We'll get you someplace safe. You can't stay here."

Seraph, with a tone of finality, stated, "I'm afraid you have to go alone."

"What?" Nyra exclaimed.

"You heard me, just take the core and leave. Save yourselves while you still can. All I'll do is slow you down," Seraph urged.

Perplexed, Nyra questioned, "I don't understand, why aren't you coming with us? You know they'll never stop sending people after you."

Seraph, with a sense of resolve, disclosed, "I made peace with my situation the moment I cut ties with AVRA, long back. Besides, I've been running and hiding all my life. I'm done running. If they want me, they'll have me, not without a fight though."

Concerned, Nyra offered, "At least let me help you get rid of the body."

Seraph redirected her, "You've already wasted too much time; now take the Nexus Core and leave." As Nyra grabbed the core and walked towards the entrance, Seraph shouted, "And close that door behind you; the noise outside makes my ears bleed. I need some peace and quiet."
