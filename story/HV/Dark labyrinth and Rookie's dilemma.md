One NuMav down, two NuMavs down, three NuMavs down; the fourth one tried to make a run for it but was eventually immobilized by the vigilant and resourceful rookie. Although not his first time triggering Tremor's algorithm to shut the augmentations down, having dealt with a fair share of Neural Mavericks back in his mercenary gun-running days for scraps. The brigadier praised him, but by a man of his experience, it can be hard to figure out if the praise is indeed genuine or mere sarcasm. The holograms and glyphs decorated onto the nearby buildings blinked for a few seconds and then came a sudden blackout.

"The rookie's still standing after the tremor, no signs of neural corruption on him. We're good to go," said the Brigadier to his subordinates moments after activating his night vision gear. They were testing him. The Brigadier had already lost five of his elite AVRA NuMav hunters to augmented sleeper cells who he once called friends. Not an easy job to win his trust. Had it not been for Dr. Tremor's parting gift, his greatest invention, just one Neural Maverick could have easily wiped out his entire brigade several times over. Their ability to shift and transfer AI consciousness from one augmented host to another within minutes and amassing an army of AI controlled husks made situations even worse. The rookie knows this; he's aware of what this tech at his disposal is capable of. He is focused on his goal; the Brigadier and his unit are just tools to help him get closer to it.

In the midst of the oppressive darkness, the rookie could feel the weight of the mission intensifying. He tightened his grip on his weapon, senses heightened, and focused on the task at hand. The dense atmosphere of uncertainty hung in the air as the team continued their cautious advance through the labyrinthine corridors of the apartment complex. The scout's revelation about the proximity of the elusive threats sent a ripple of tension through the group. The Brigadier's calm demeanor provided a strange reassurance, a veteran's confidence in the face of the unknown. The rookie observed the seasoned leader with a mix of suspicion and respect, trying to decipher the true motives behind the mission. As they moved forward on a mission to recover AVRA's stolen top secret tech, the neon-lit advertisements and holographic glyphs flickered intermittently, casting fleeting shadows on the walls. The maze of cables and debris, remnants of the tremor, made each step a deliberate effort. The eerie silence persisted, broken only by the occasional hum of malfunctioning electronics.

Suddenly, the rookie's night vision picked up a subtle change in the environment. A distant sound, barely audible over the electronic buzzing, echoed through the dim corridors. The scout's earlier warning seemed validated as the team halted, their collective breath held in anticipation. The veteran scout's observation triggered a strategic response from the Brigadier, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the element of surprise. The rookie, caught between trust and skepticism, felt a surge of adrenaline. His focus sharpened on the potential threats lurking in the shadows, his instincts urging him to stay vigilant.

The rhythmic clashing of carbon on the damp floor resumed as the team pressed forward. The rookie's finger traced the trigger, his senses finely tuned to any sign of movement. The darkened corridors became a theater of suspense, with the enigmatic Brigadier leading the way into the heart of the unknown, and the rookie poised for whatever awaited them in the shadows.

As they ventured deeper, the eerie silence persisted, broken only by the distant hum of malfunctioning electronics. The scout's earlier warning echoed in their minds, heightening the anticipation. The veteran's strategic decision to maintain the element of surprise emphasized the gravity of the situation.

Suddenly, the environment shifted again. The air became charged with an unsettling energy. The rookie's augmented senses picked up on subtle vibrations, indicating movement ahead. The Brigadier signaled for the team to halt. The grizzled veteran, unfazed by the growing tension, whispered orders to the scouts.

The rookie's gaze shifted between the Brigadier and the impenetrable darkness ahead. The anticipation hung thick in the air as they awaited the next move of the augmented sleeper cells. The atmosphere, already laden with suspense, reached a crescendo, setting the stage for a confrontation in the heart of the post-tremor labyrinth.

With the team on high alert, the rookie's senses strained to decipher the source of the subtle vibrations. The Brigadier, a stoic figure in the shadows, maintained a calm exterior, concealing the depth of his experience. The scout, eyes fixed on the unknown, awaited further instructions. A faint whisper of voices emerged from the darkness, carrying an ominous undertone. The rookie adjusted his grip on the weapon, heart pounding in anticipation. The Brigadier's hand gestured for silence, a signal echoed through the ranks. The scouts, trained to navigate the intricacies of urban warfare, melted into the surroundings, their carbon fiber boots barely making a sound. The whispers grew louder, morphing into indistinct words. The rookie strained to decipher the conversation ahead. A sudden realization struck him – these weren't random sleeper cells; they were organized, communicating in a language only a few could understand. The mission took a darker turn, unveiling a clandestine operation beyond their initial expectations.

The Brigadier's eyes met the rookie's, a silent exchange laden with unspoken understanding. Whatever awaited them ahead went beyond routine NuMav hunting; it was a revelation that shook the core of their mission. The veteran's experience became a beacon in the shadows, guiding the team through the labyrinthine complexities of this unexpected challenge. As the whispers intensified, a soft glow emanated from the depths of the corridor. The neon-lit glyphs on the walls flickered with newfound life, revealing a hidden enclave bathed in an eerie, otherworldly light. The scout's night vision captured the scene – a clandestine meeting, augmented figures cloaked in shadows, discussing plans that went far beyond the scope of a mere NuMav hunt.

The rookie, torn between duty and the unraveling secrets before him, awaited the Brigadier's command. The atmosphere thickened with intrigue, and the post-tremor darkness unveiled not just a physical labyrinth but a web of conspiracies that threatened to entangle them all.
The rookie's gaze lingered on the holographic display, contemplating the gravity of the mission's new direction. A conflicting whirlwind of loyalty and ambition brewed within him. The Nexus Core, a potential game-changer, held promises of power and influence that resonated with his hidden aspirations. 

As the NuMav hunters prepared to disrupt the clandestine meeting, the rookie found himself at a crossroads. The Brigadier, unaware of the internal struggle, conferred final instructions. "Listen close. We need to neutralize them fast before they get a chance to shift. Brembec, you will lead the demolition team to the back entrance and await orders until the scouts make their move. Kenfer and Retha, hold your positions near the window and be ready to assist Brembec with your sniper rifles. Remember, if they catch any of you and initiate the shifting sequence, don't hesitate to put one straight to the brain. If you don't, I sure as hell will and I want each one of you to do the same to me if I get caught. And kid!" the veteran whispered fixing his gaze towards the rookie who stood crouched besides both the scouts, "You and the scouts with me! We'll breach the front door, provide the snipers and Brembec's team enough time so they can take them by surprise. The scouts will keep the algorithm ready and heated if this goes sideways".

In that crucial moment, the rookie's decision took form. Loyalty to the Brigadier warred with the allure of the Nexus Core's potential. The enigmatic figure had been his mentor, yet the prospect of seizing control of the powerful technology ignited a spark of ambition within him.
A subtle nod to the Brigadier masked the rookie's internal turmoil. The plan unfolded seamlessly, the NuMav hunters strategically disrupting the meeting. Chaos ensued as the augmented figures scattered in disarray. Amidst the confusion, the rookie seized the opportunity, making a covert detour toward the Nexus Core's location.

The Brigadier, engrossed in the skirmish, remained oblivious to the rookie's divergence. As the rookie approached the secured facility, a profound sense of uncertainty gripped him. Loyalty clashed with ambition, and in that pivotal moment, the decision hung in the balance.
The rookie stood before the Nexus Core, contemplating the potential consequences of his actions. Betrayal lingered in the air, but so did the allure of wielding a power that could reshape the world. The choice rested on the razor's edge.

With two consecutive explosions, Brembec barges in through the hole in the wall. Two NuMavs affected by the concussion are taken down immediately. Several more are laid down by supercharged LMG rounds. The demolition team is suddenly hit by a smoke canister. Brembec, disoriented by the lack of visibility is attacked from behind in an attempt to switch from Night Vision to Thermal Vision. Retha immediately neutralizes the threat with her handy sniper rifle.

With Thermal Optics now at his disposal, Brembec quickly runs his eyes around and realizes the only heat signatures he's reading are from his own comrades. "They are using ThermoVeil!", he shouts in frustration. The echo of his muffled voice is heard across the room and within seconds, the entire apartment is engulfed in a thick cloud of smoke rendering the sniper team, the eyes of the unit, out of options.

Both scouts who can only rely on their ears now, quickly make a run for the upper floor with their tactical flashlight. One of the scouts gets hit in his right shoulder by a bullet from a silenced weapon and the other is grabbed by the neck moments after by a tall shadowy figure through the smoke. The NuMav plugs in and initiates the shifting sequence. The scout finally coming to terms with the situation he found himself in, gradually losing control triggers Tremor's Algorithm yet again immediately neutralizing multiple NuMavs in the vicinity and losing his senses in the process.

A clean shot between the eyes by his old friend Kenfer, finally puts the scout to rest. Retha witnessing the distressing scene mumbles "We can never be sure how many of them actually are there, can we?". Kenfer realizing sorrow and panic in her voice says, "You know, after they shift and let the Nexus take control of the next host, the AI can capture their memories so that it can mimic their behavior. So there is no way to know if they really are alive or shifters. The mind is gone, it just the Nexus playing impersonator". Retha unable to find any reassurance in Kenfer's response asks, "Don't you find it appalling to be working for an organization that could create something like this, cause so much death and destruction?". Kenfer shuts her down by saying, "AVRA's intentions with the Nexus Core were never malicious. We wouldn't even be here had these Neura-lunatics never got the wind of it and stole it in the first place. Also, is this treason and disrespect I'm sensing in your voice, Lieutenant? Don't forget, I'm still your superior and can effectively report you to the Brigadier". Retha concludes confidently, "You do that. But first, we both need to make it out of here alive so respectfully Captain, keep your mouth shut and focus on the mission". Kenfer looks at her strangely calm face with annoyance.

As the rookie held the Nexus Core in his hands, glancing across the giant AVRA (Aegis Visionaries in Robotic Advancements) logo embedded onto the core, he attempted to make his exit through the breached back entrance. The smoke and stench of gunpowder still lingered in the air as he calculatedly leaped towards the hole. However, his escape was abruptly halted by the unexpected sight of a NuMav waiting—standing still in the dark, observing his prey. As the augmented husk began to close the distance, the rookie took aim with his trusty old pistol, firing two accurate, clean shots—one through the brain and the other through the torso. Surprisingly, it wasn't the rookie who pulled the trigger; an imposing figure emerged from the hole with his weapon lowered.

"Leaving already?" the muffled words reached the rookie. "Colonel...," the rookie responded to Brembec's familiar voice. Although his face was hidden behind his Navigation headgear, the rookie could almost imagine his fiery red eyes fuming with anger. A new challenge awaited the rookie in a rugged, short-tempered second-in-command elite NuMav hunter.

As the rookie reached for his pistol, his finger tightened, but he felt an overpowering push to the chest, and Brembec yanked the firearm away into the impenetrable darkness. Left to his own devices, the rookie had to defend himself against a formidable opponent who was equally frustrated but twice as deadly.

Taking a few heavy blows to his chest, the rookie collapsed. Down on the floor, as he tried to recover and reach the Nexus Core, Brembec interrupted him and then grabbed it. The ever-vigilant rookie grabbed his military knife without delay and slashed across Brembec's forearm, making an already aggressive Colonel even more furious.

Now that the smoke was starting to clear out, three consecutive gunshots fired upwards, with a slight delay after each shot, were heard. The rookie quickly recognized the signal from his training days and found the Brigadier with his pistol up in the air, standing at a distance. Kenfer stood firmly beside him, ready with his rifle aimed at the rookie's head, and Retha patched up the wounded scout near the stairs.As the smoke cleared even more, all four of Brembec's men became visible, holding strategic locations throughout the room with their LMGs ready and fixated at the two men involved in close-quarter combat. The tension in the air escalated as the NuMav hunters positioned themselves, ready for any further developments. The Brigadier's steely gaze bore into the rookie, silently urging him to stand down. The rookie, battered and bruised, faced not only the physical threat of Brembec but also the scrutiny of his own team. The Nexus Core, now in the possession of the Colonel, added another layer of complexity to the unfolding situation. The mission had taken an unexpected turn, and the rookie found himself at the center of a storm that threatened not only the success of the operation but the trust of his comrades.

"You two, stand still where you are! Don't move," the Brigadier commanded, his authoritative voice cutting through the lingering tension. "He tried to escape with the core, sir. Why is he still alive?" responded the fuming Colonel, his voice muffled through the headgear. "I think he got jumped. He has neural corruption; the moment he realized we nearly wiped them all out, he tried to make a run for it with the core. Don't know how many more he'll shift. We made a mistake bringing him here. Let me do the honors," Brembec continued after a slight pause. The Brigadier, stroking his beard, said, "We'll trigger one more tremor; if he's already shifted, he'll perish." Brembec responds with growing impatience, "Don't be ridiculous! You know how fast these things are. Let me do it the quick way. I know tha..."

A loud blast shocks everyone in the room, and the Colonel kisses the ground before he could complete his sentence. A three-inch bullet hole caused by a plasma round through his cooked headgear and a pool of blood on the floor. The rookie, shocked at the sight, moves his eyes towards the Brigadier, who is holding his gun straight, calm and composed after taking the shot. The eerie silence combined with everyone's horrified expressions after the execution stayed for a moment before the Brigadier said in a tired voice, "The real Brem would have never questioned my authority. The mere mention of a tremor made him panic. He got jumped by one of the husks and shifted. I was watching him; I was watching all of you, through the Thermal Vision. The ThermoVeil can hide them, but it can't hide any of you. The moment I stopped getting Brem's thermal readings, I knew difficult decisions need to be made."

Amidst the haunting aftermath of the Brigadier's decisive shot, the room plunged into an eerie silence. The rookie's eyes lingered on the lifeless body of Brembec, his second-in-command, now confirmed to be a husk controlled by the Nexus Core. The once covert mission had unraveled into a complex web of deceit and impending danger.As the gravity of the situation sank in, the Brigadier, with a wearied expression, turned to the rookie. "We need to move, and quickly," he urged, acknowledging the lingering threat of the Nexus Core. 

The rookie, still processing the recent events, nodded in agreement. The Nexus, with its ability to manipulate memories and imitate behavior, had woven a tangled web around them.In the shadows, the rest of the team, comprised of Kenfer, Retha, and the wounded scout, awaited further instructions. The room became a nexus of tension, each member contemplating the unfolding reality. It was then that the Brigadier, with a hint of weariness in his voice, began to unveil the intricacies of the Neural Mavericks' stages of corruption."Listen closely, rookie," the Brigadier said, as the team gathered around. "The Nexus operates in stages: Shifting, Transition, and Husk. Shifting involves the takeover of a fresh host, allowing the Nexus to mimic their memories and behavior. The Tremor's algorithm can rescue a victim during this stage, but timing is crucial."The veteran continued, "Transition is where the mind deteriorates, and control is lost. Triggering the algorithm becomes a hit or miss, and success isn't guaranteed. In the Husk stage, victims either become mindless husks or, in a more sinister turn, deceased ones are repurposed into cannon fodder. Tremor's algorithm can neutralize them, but it can't bring the dead back to life."As the Brigadier spoke, he revealed the science behind Tremor's algorithm, explaining its Bio-Resonance Disruption. "The algorithm emits frequencies that resonate with healthy brain tissue, disrupting the Nexus's control. The resulting tremors are a necessary evil, a side effect of disconnecting the corrupted signal."

The rookie absorbed the information, the complexity of their enemy becoming clearer. Meanwhile, Kenfer and Retha exchanged glances, silently acknowledging the severity of the situation. The Brigadier's revelation prompted a sense of urgency, pushing the team to tread carefully through the tremor-prone environment.

In the midst of this, the veteran addressed the concerns raised earlier. "I observed you all, but revealing Brembec's shift too soon would have jeopardized our plan. We needed to expose the Nexus's location and intentions. As for Kenfer eliminating the corrupted scout, we couldn't risk him triggering the shifting sequence. It's a harsh reality, but we're in a fight for survival against a formidable enemy."

The room's tension heightened, and the Brigadier issued orders for their next move. "We trigger another tremor. We can't afford to let the Nexus escape with the Core. The apartment's structural integrity is compromised, and this tremor might give us the advantage we need. Prepare yourselves."As the rookie initiated the algorithm, a violent tremor shook the already weakened building. Cracks spread across the walls, and debris rained down as the structure groaned under the strain. The team moved with urgency, navigating the collapsing environment.

In the chaos, the rookie glimpsed an opportunity to escape. With firearm in hand and the Nexus Core secured, he navigated the treacherous terrain, narrowly avoiding falling debris. The collapsing building became a metaphor for their mission, teetering on the edge of success and disaster.

As the rookie emerged into the chaotic cityscape, the fate of the rest of the unit remained uncertain. The collapse had scattered them, leaving their whereabouts unknown. The rookie, catching his breath, faced the looming threat of the Nexus, determined to unravel its insidious plans.
