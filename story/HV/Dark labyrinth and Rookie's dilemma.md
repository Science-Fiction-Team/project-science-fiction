One NuMav down, two NuMavs down, three NuMavs down; the fourth one tried to make a run for it but was eventually immobilized by the vigilant and resourceful rookie. Although not his first time triggering Tremor's algorithm to shut the augmentations down, having dealt with a fair share of Neural Mavericks back in his mercenary gun-running days for scraps. The brigadier praised him, but by a man of his experience, it can be hard to figure out if the praise is indeed genuine or mere sarcasm. The holograms and glyphs decorated onto the nearby buildings blinked for a few seconds and then came a sudden blackout.

"The rookie's still standing after the tremor, no signs of neural corruption on him. We're good to go," said the Brigadier to his subordinates moments after activating his night vision gear. They were testing him. The Brigadier had already lost five of his elite AVRA NuMav hunters to augmented sleeper cells who he once called friends. Not an easy job to win his trust. Had it not been for Dr. Tremor's parting gift, his greatest invention, just one Neural Maverick could have easily wiped out his entire brigade several times over. Their ability to shift and transfer AI consciousness from one augmented host to another within minutes and amassing an army of AI controlled husks made situations even worse. The rookie knows this; he's aware of what this tech at his disposal is capable of. He is focused on his goal; the Brigadier and his unit are just tools to help him get closer to it.

In the midst of the oppressive darkness, the rookie could feel the weight of the mission intensifying. He tightened his grip on his weapon, senses heightened, and focused on the task at hand. The dense atmosphere of uncertainty hung in the air as the team continued their cautious advance through the labyrinthine corridors of the apartment complex. The scout's revelation about the proximity of the elusive threats sent a ripple of tension through the group. The Brigadier's calm demeanor provided a strange reassurance, a veteran's confidence in the face of the unknown. The rookie observed the seasoned leader with a mix of suspicion and respect, trying to decipher the true motives behind the mission. As they moved forward on a mission to recover AVRA's stolen top secret tech, the neon-lit advertisements and holographic glyphs flickered intermittently, casting fleeting shadows on the walls. The maze of cables and debris, remnants of the tremor, made each step a deliberate effort. The eerie silence persisted, broken only by the occasional hum of malfunctioning electronics.

Suddenly, the rookie's night vision picked up a subtle change in the environment. A distant sound, barely audible over the electronic buzzing, echoed through the dim corridors. The scout's earlier warning seemed validated as the team halted, their collective breath held in anticipation. The veteran scout's observation triggered a strategic response from the Brigadier, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the element of surprise. The rookie, caught between trust and skepticism, felt a surge of adrenaline. His focus sharpened on the potential threats lurking in the shadows, his instincts urging him to stay vigilant.

The rhythmic clashing of carbon on the damp floor resumed as the team pressed forward. The rookie's finger traced the trigger, his senses finely tuned to any sign of movement. The darkened corridors became a theater of suspense, with the enigmatic Brigadier leading the way into the heart of the unknown, and the rookie poised for whatever awaited them in the shadows.

As they ventured deeper, the eerie silence persisted, broken only by the distant hum of malfunctioning electronics. The scout's earlier warning echoed in their minds, heightening the anticipation. The veteran's strategic decision to maintain the element of surprise emphasized the gravity of the situation.

Suddenly, the environment shifted again. The air became charged with an unsettling energy. The rookie's augmented senses picked up on subtle vibrations, indicating movement ahead. The Brigadier signaled for the team to halt. The grizzled veteran, unfazed by the growing tension, whispered orders to the scouts.

The rookie's gaze shifted between the Brigadier and the impenetrable darkness ahead. The anticipation hung thick in the air as they awaited the next move of the augmented sleeper cells. The atmosphere, already laden with suspense, reached a crescendo, setting the stage for a confrontation in the heart of the post-tremor labyrinth.

With the team on high alert, the rookie's senses strained to decipher the source of the subtle vibrations. The Brigadier, a stoic figure in the shadows, maintained a calm exterior, concealing the depth of his experience. The scout, eyes fixed on the unknown, awaited further instructions. A faint whisper of voices emerged from the darkness, carrying an ominous undertone. The rookie adjusted his grip on the weapon, heart pounding in anticipation. The Brigadier's hand gestured for silence, a signal echoed through the ranks. The scouts, trained to navigate the intricacies of urban warfare, melted into the surroundings, their carbon fiber boots barely making a sound. The whispers grew louder, morphing into indistinct words. The rookie strained to decipher the conversation ahead. A sudden realization struck him – these weren't random sleeper cells; they were organized, communicating in a language only a few could understand. The mission took a darker turn, unveiling a clandestine operation beyond their initial expectations.

The Brigadier's eyes met the rookie's, a silent exchange laden with unspoken understanding. Whatever awaited them ahead went beyond routine NuMav hunting; it was a revelation that shook the core of their mission. The veteran's experience became a beacon in the shadows, guiding the team through the labyrinthine complexities of this unexpected challenge. As the whispers intensified, a soft glow emanated from the depths of the corridor. The neon-lit glyphs on the walls flickered with newfound life, revealing a hidden enclave bathed in an eerie, otherworldly light. The scout's night vision captured the scene – a clandestine meeting, augmented figures cloaked in shadows, discussing plans that went far beyond the scope of a mere NuMav hunt.

The rookie, torn between duty and the unraveling secrets before him, awaited the Brigadier's command. The atmosphere thickened with intrigue, and the post-tremor darkness unveiled not just a physical labyrinth but a web of conspiracies that threatened to entangle them all.
The rookie's gaze lingered on the holographic display, contemplating the gravity of the mission's new direction. A conflicting whirlwind of loyalty and ambition brewed within him. The Nexus Core, a potential game-changer, held promises of power and influence that resonated with his hidden aspirations. 

As the NuMav hunters prepared to disrupt the clandestine meeting, the rookie found himself at a crossroads. The Brigadier, unaware of the internal struggle, conferred final instructions. "Listen close. We need to neutralize them fast before they get a chance to shift. Brembec, you will lead the demolition team to the back entrance and await orders until the scouts make their move. Kenfer and Retha, hold your positions near the window and be ready to assist Brembec with your sniper rifles. Remember, if they catch any of you and initiate the shifting sequence, don't hesitate to put one staright to the brain. If you don't, I sure as hell will and I want each one of you to do the same to me if I get caught. And kid!" the veteran whispered fixing his gaze towards the rookie who stood crouched besides both the scouts, "You and the scouts with me! We'll breach the front door, provide the snipers and Brembec's team enough time so they can take them by surprise. The scouts will keep the algorithm heated if this goes sideways".

In that crucial moment, the rookie's decision took form. Loyalty to the Brigadier warred with the allure of the Nexus Core's potential. The enigmatic figure had been his mentor, yet the prospect of seizing control of the powerful technology ignited a spark of ambition within him.
A subtle nod to the Brigadier masked the rookie's internal turmoil. The plan unfolded seamlessly, the NuMav hunters strategically disrupting the meeting. Chaos ensued as the augmented figures scattered in disarray. Amidst the confusion, the rookie seized the opportunity, making a covert detour toward the Nexus Core's location.

The Brigadier, engrossed in the skirmish, remained oblivious to the rookie's divergence. As the rookie approached the secured facility, a profound sense of uncertainty gripped him. Loyalty clashed with ambition, and in that pivotal moment, the decision hung in the balance.
The rookie stood before the Nexus Core, contemplating the potential consequences of his actions. Betrayal lingered in the air, but so did the allure of wielding a power that could reshape the world. The choice rested on the razor's edge.

With two consecutive explosions, Brembec barges in through the hole in the wall. Two NuMavs affected by the concussion are taken down immediately. Several more are laid down by supercharged LMG rounds. The demolition team is suddenly hit by a smoke canister. Brembec, disoriented by the lack of visibility is attacked from behind in an attempt to switch from Night Vision to Thermal Vision. Retha immediately neutralizes the threat with her handy sniper rifle.

With Thermal Optics now at his disposal, Brembec quicly runs his eyes around and realizes the only heat signatures he's reading are from his own comrades. "They are using ThermoVeil!", he shouts in frustration. The echo of his muffled voice is heard across the room and within seconds, the entire apartment is engulfed in a thick cloud of smoke rendering the sniper team, the eyes of the unit, out of options.

Both scouts who can only rely on their ears now, quickly make a run for the upper floor with their tactical flashlight. One of the scouts gets hit in his right shoulder by a bullet from a silenced weapon and the other is grabbed by the neck moments after by a tall shadowy figure through the smoke. The NuMav plugs in and initiates the shifting sequence. The scout finally coming to terms with the situation he found himself in, gradually losing control triggers Tremor's Algorithm yet again immediately neutralizing multiple NuMavs in the vicinity and losing his senses in the process.

A clean shot between the eyes by his old friend Kenfer, finally puts the scout to rest. Retha witnessing the distressing scene mumbles "We can never be sure how many of them actually are there, can we?". Kenfer realizing sorrow and panic in her voice says, "You know, after they shift and let the Nexus take control of the next host, the AI can capture their memories so that it can mimic their behavior. So there is no way to know if they really are alive or shifters. The mind is gone, it just the Nexus playing impersonator". Retha unable to find any reassurance in Kenfer's response asks, "Don't you find it appalling to be working for an organization that could create something like this, cause so much death and destruction?". Kenfer shuts her down by saying, "AVRA's intentions with the Nexus Core were never malicious. We wouldn't even be here had these Neura-lunatics never got the wind of it and stole it in the first place. Also, is this treason and disrespect I'm sensing in your voice, Lieutenant? Don't forget, I'm still your superior and can effectively report you to the Brigadier". Retha concludes confidently, "You do that. But first, we both need to make it out of here alive so respectfully Captain, keep your mouth shut and focus on the mission". Kenfer looks at her strangely calm face with annoyance.

The rookie finally holding the Nexus Core in his hands, glances across the giant AVRA(Aegis Visionaries in Robotic Advancements) logo embedded onto the core, tries to make his exit out the breached back entrance.
