# Ending ideas

Protagonist eventually escapes to real world and is given a choice by the observers:

1. To embrace and accept new reality and follow mundane and boring routine, work like a cog in the machine.
2. To go back to the simulation and back to all the friends and family and reset the simulation. (Viscous cycle continues)

Leave the ending in a limbo(undecided fate)
