# Concepts(World building)

1. Upper city - UC(for elites)
2. Lower city - LC(for destitutes)
3. Almost all sunlight gets blocked and doesn't reach LC so LC citizens use artificial lighting to grow crops and food.
4. Scarcity of water in LC. Waste and flush water of UC gets recycled down to LC. Trash and organic waste material from above are used to make fertilizers which is used along with artificial lighting to grow crops in LC.
5. LC citizens are heavily taxed and in return, they get weekly airdrops from UC via parachutes containing food, medicines, clothes and other necessities.
6. Poverty tourism - Rich kids use a one-way transparent metro that runs around the middle section of UC and LC. They observe day to day struggles of LC citizens like animals in a zoo.
7. LC not allowed to have their own police or military. All protection is provided by guards from UC(protection in return for heavy taxes).
